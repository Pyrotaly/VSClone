Goals: Work on Boss AI = implement moves (final) + make moves do damage, 

No rebinding...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csqVa2Vimao but here is a video if I were to

Particle System
Audio System//And saving here with playerPreSet or something

Polish:
GunFeel DRAWING: Make enemy designs, (also a picture of how to play)
Level Design
Make Switching Weapons with other buttons somehow (probably learning how player can rebind button stuff),
ART: add dash animation

Future Notes: Probably add namespaces on bigger projects, Assemblies or something

Fix Krita middle mouse: https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/comments/roeds7/strange_middle_click_behavior_with_krita/

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
}In Unity I DID THIS:
Go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics2d and Uncheck the box that says "Raycasts Start In Colliders".
This will let you ignore the colliders on the gameobject casting them.

FIX THE LICENSE ISSUE WITH THIS VIDEO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcC40ZE4WPU

>>>>>>> main
This allows enemy to shoot projectile while ignoring their own collider

}The behavior tree asset has a wierd bug where it has a white grid background.  To fix this, go to project settings, player, 
scroll down to other settings, and change the color space back and forth from gamma and linear

Bullet Despawn Manager, since the game is dungeon crawlerish, all bullet will eventually hit a wall and that will despawn the bullet

BUGS: 10/16, 11/3, 11/14

}Added A*.  When scanning obstacles with A*, make sure to add colliders on obstacles
}Added bullet script for ranged enemies, could just reuse code for player bullet
}Might need to review courotines more
}FINISHED BASIC AI

GOAL: MAKE MAP
========
10/28-29/2022
--------
GOAL: Make BOSS AI?
}Not sure if making randomized map is the good idea.  Might be better to focus on making a simple polished game.
}Work on like 5 levels.  Hotline Miami style
}5 Bosses, one is like a flood movement boss like Ori and the Blind Forest but it is reoccuring (blood flood).

Basic Sum of Bosses, more detail below
FIRST BASIC BOSS: Basic Enemy that is super strong who spawn mini version of it.  Bullet hell basically.  The mini version can be reoccuring enemy

BLOOD FLOOD BOSS: First introduced as a boss to make player work on movement skill.  Will comeback again as another mechanic

CLONE BOSS: Make a boss with similar movements and attacks as player (but more animated and not just a hopping blob).
}How to make this boss like mimic the player for the first half

DIMENSION WARPING BOSS THING: How to shift game from top down to a 2d.  Bullet hell, nothing else special, maybe just a boss testing all player skill

FINAL BOSS: Like Furi Final Boss (not the spaceship alien thing) where the player just shoots at the monsters organs 



FIRST BASIC BOSS: Mechanics: Spawn Mini Enemies (maybe only one or two max), shoot lots of bullets like Enter the Gungeon.  Maybe a phase of missile based attacks, final phase of bombs?
				Killing mini enemies will give player like a 30 second window of no enemy


BLOOD FOOD BOSS:

CLONE BOSS: I feel like this boss should be the boss with lazers, swords, axes and other cool weapons in phase 2 and 3 and maybe 4. Needs a cutscene
	
DIMENSION WARPING BOSS: Have more cells.  When changing dimension with the animation, remove all mini enemies and then spawn in mini enemies depending on the phase.  
Maybe add in the Clone Boss but weaker with less damage and less health in the final phase


========
10/28-29/2022
--------
GOAL: Work on BOSS AI and make enemy designs

ENEMY TYPES: Walk and touch player and deal damage (Vampire survivor), enemy stuck on walls that shoot, enemies that move and shoot, enemies that spawn enemies.  
			REUSED ENEMIES: The mini enemy in BOSS 1, BOSS 3 weaker version

TOTAL ENEMIES = 6

}Enemy does not shoot player because the ray cast is hitting its own boxcollider.  How to make it shoot not itself?}
}Make all enemy bullets ignore all enemy related things
}I think the layer, enemyCollides is to let player run through enemies even though they will take damage
}Make a way to make levels easy
}NEED TO MAKE ENEMYSTUCKONWALLRANGE Not walkable
}If Player is Dead, it will no longer move through enemies 
}BUG: Enemy can like walk through the wall due to A* not considering boxcolliders, to deal with this, I will try to make enemy sprite smaller
and make the terrain cannot walk area bigger (Located in A* object in Unity)
Basically, make everything smaller but terrain bigger
}RN, if want to change bullet damage from an entity, cannot change it from entity, have to see the prefab entity has and change it there

}To make swapping thing, player list of weapon, adding gameobject and scroll through player item list

========
11/5/2022
--------
GOAL: Make player pick up weapon stuff
Player will have infinite weapon switching.  Basically, I will give player all weapons they can have possibly have like Doom

https://youtu.be/q85gG0GLyG0?t=380 I think this tutorial is my answer to weapon swapping
}Have sprite object on player that can be replaced

BUGS: When swtiching weapon, can swap weapon and each weapon will shoot but the console has this error of courtoine not happening because the game object is not active which is what I want...


========
11/6/2022
--------
GOAL: Make room switching like Binding of Issac or Celeste

new idea to make item allowed, have a bool if weapon is useable, if true than can use it

Currently pick up is picked up via checking tag collision.  Maybe it could be a layer also

GUN PICK UP NOW WORKS

GOAL NOW: MAKE BOSS

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dlEl_G713A Bullet Hell Thing

Change Enemy Structure to have Composition.  Basically, have ranged attacks or not 


========
11/14/2022
--------
GOAL: Need to work on boss bullet. Maybe draw. Finish game mechanics before making art
}Player Dash should not be in direction of mouse, direction they are moving
}Adding Has Dash Script
}Dash now works
}BUG: When player is idle, dashing will do nothing because dashing is based on player Vector2 (which is 0 when idle).  Need to make it dash in direction player facing: Handle Direction and rework animation stuff

Peashooter gun like pistol in Doom 2016, there for backup

Add a speed function when shooting bullet in gun Shoot function

When putting player in new scene, it needs to have reference to camera for mouse controller

Maybe in first boss, when spawning in enemy, have it spawn in the corners

When beat boss, take the boss gun and take it stuff

Hitscan gun, make boss that dodge normal bullet so need hitscan

Make bullet spin in circle https://youtu.be/1q7qlmOFRtY?t=2705  Probably for clone second boss

For first boss, make it so that hitting boss the boss could become smaller and then that make it faster making the game hard,  use for narattive story telling thing

} FSM for basic enemies?  Probably not needed just need to flesh out the ai a bit more.
Here is video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VkezxxjsSE

ENEMY TYPES: Walk and touch player and deal damage (Vampire survivor), enemy stuck on walls that shoot, enemies that move and shoot (but keep distance), enemies that spawn enemies (walk randomly?).  
			REUSED ENEMIES: The mini enemy in BOSS 1 (just beefy enemy), BOSS 3 weaker version (reuse)

TOTAL ENEMIES = 6

No need for health composition refacotring since code rn works fine

} For the future bosses, use the same bullet spawn pool script but in the scene, have a different bullet prefab or something
} DOTween is an asset apparently
} Use BulletML for bullet hell patters

} For spiral attack, need to make it last for more than a mili sec for the spiral to form
} Thinking on how to do missile attack

It will be like the bird missile attack and enemy spawning indicator in Enter the Gungeon

https://youtu.be/QSvfjt3MpP4?t=187 Example for enemy spawning indicator

Two Things: Show an Indicator of Something, Spawn Something
These can be two different scripts

========
12/20/2022
--------
Spawn Script can be used in many things like opening chest, spawning gun at end of level, enemy spawning
} Triangle animation to temporary missle launch indication

To make spiral attack, had to use repeat and wait tasks

For missile, could have the spawners near the edge of the map so that it would not spawn on top of boss

Need to make attributes thingy to organize my tasks


========
12/21/2022
--------
} Copying the charge attack from the wierd green monster thing from dead cells
} Finished first phase of boss, though does no damage to player
} Work on player direction, boss dealing damage, UI, then game states

Player will symetrical, so just need to flip, not an 8 directional system though Boss 2 will probably be

Player direction rn is okay imo.  Dashes down if no input.  Since player is not using 8 direction thing, it will be confusing where dashing
Make it so that only dash if player moving??

Cannot see anything in game scene because each room has its own CM vcam.  They only turn on once game starts.

} Making basic health bar and what gun is being used

work with better namingConventions in future games
} MADE HEALTH BAR

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSlv4Fc3D74 this is how to change UI image

add a vignette? https://youtu.be/V-iuC8x_3TA?t=26

} Trying to understand what game manager is going to do.  I think, it just keeps track of guns and health player has if there was saving
or like loading to a new scene.  It good for when player die and need to reload scene

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmobsXZSRKo this is for loading scene thing

I think, just need to make main menu game with buttons.  Only buttons that would work is exit game and enter game.

Make button change text when selected?

Need to figure out scene names or something
Need to add scenes to build so game can actually switch scenes

The only states game would have is pause game, load scene, gameover

I think I will work on saving game.


========
12/23/2022

} FINISHED ALL MENU UI except options but not any button functions since need to finish Options
} Working on save feature
} Note, when having game over thing, there is an animation on the entire UI image that increases the opacity of it to 100%

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csqVa2Vimao this is how to rebind stuff

}Things that in settings, Mouse Sensitivity, Resolution, QUality, Full Screen, Post Processing, Brightness
Key binding

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOaYQrN1oYQ this brackey's video has thing on setting up volume

Make game start with High Graphics quality

========
12/24/2022
--------
} The graphics are automatically high but will not update the dropdown in the options menu
} All the exit to desktop things need refernce to DataPersistenceManager to access its application quit method, only one quit method???
} Make making comments more consistent in the future

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html this is how to save at a location or something

C:\Users\Minha\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany  So apparently, the data stored inthe file called ShopGame, so I changed it to VSClone
Does not work if i change the name to VSClone.

Need to make healthbar update DONE

========
12/25/2022
--------
} Adding checkpoint system since that would work with the save system when player would want to reload.  Not going to have multiple scenes
} Instead, have one scene for dungeons, another scene for bosses

Here is saving system, will save at beginning of each room.  So if player reloads during a battle, it will reset the battle
} Too lazy, just split it up with scenes.  So 6 scenes, in total, 2 dungeons, boss, 2 dungeons, boss
} Impletemend checkpoint system.  Since the player spawns on top of the checkpoint, i do not need to save the last checkpoint since 
spawning on the checkpoint will automatically make it have reference to the most reent check point


There are two types of Unity saving, additive and single.  My game is single saving

Need to have that game only saves at certain points and not everytime the player quits.  Made my game save between scenes

Do I even need to have save slots in this game?  Just implement because every game has it (except games like Cod...)

I will not implement save slot system for this game.  Will be like Miami Hotline GAME DESIGN: Before scene transition, heal player's health

========
12/26/2022
--------
Saving in this game will just be at checkpoints.

Learning how to do level select.  Fading in between scenes.  MADE LEVEL CHANGER HANDLER thing.

So each game will have its own level Handler.  Other things will call it to make the level handler switch to it
PlayerPrefs vs using save file to manage level progress.

Learned Player Prefs!

PlayerPrefs is good for menu settings.  Save file for level completed https://youtu.be/aUi9aijvpgs?t=1062 return here to save with dictionaries
Only need to know what level to be unlocked in main menu -- Will set dictionary with boolean value for main menu load to check

========
12/27/2022
--------
Need to try if level selects worked or not

Okay, when making level, need player to get reference to camera, canvas with healh bar script on player too.  Need player set health adjusted on health bar script

Need to make game load when switching to new scene

Implementing bandaid solution.  The DataPersistenceManager only gets reference to things with the Interface if the object is enabled.
The main menu button has things that require the DPM to get but can't since it inactive.

Need to make options saved in player prefs and then done

Too lazy to make saving with guns so before player pick up gun, have checkpoint before picking up gun  

SAVING AND LEVEL SELECT DONE!!

Adding Drawings.  I think this is the best so far.
3840 X 2160 200 PPI.  Play with FilterMode in Unity?
For smaller characters in game, draw them smaller in Krita.  Scaling makes things blurry in Unity

Try with 7.00 px with Krita

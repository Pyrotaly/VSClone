Goals: HARD: Work on Boss AI, Level Design, GunFeel DRAWING: Make enemy designs, Make Switching Weapons with other buttons somehow (probably learning how player can rebind button stuff)

TODO: Dash a distance based on player direction if not moving

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
}In Unity I DID THIS:
Go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics2d and Uncheck the box that says "Raycasts Start In Colliders".
This will let you ignore the colliders on the gameobject casting them. 
https://answers.unity.com/questions/279514/raycast-ignore-trigger-colliders.html

}The behavior tree asset has a wierd bug where it has a white grid background.  To fix this, go to project settings, player, 
scroll down to other settings, and change the color space back and forth from gamma and linear

This allows enemy to shoot projectile while ignoring their own collider

Bullet Despawn Manager, since the game is dungeon crawlerish, all bullet will eventually hit a wall and that will despawn the bullet

BUGS: 10/16, 11/3, 11/14
TODO FUTURE: Make Scroll Wheel Switch Weapon somehow.  It is coded in but not sure if will do what I want

}Added A*.  When scanning obstacles with A*, make sure to add colliders on obstacles
}Added bullet script for ranged enemies, could just reuse code for player bullet
}Might need to review courotines more
}FINISHED BASIC AI
}Starting to implement health and damage system
}Added a PlayerBullet layer to ignore collision with player layer
}FINISHED HITTING AND HEALTH SYSTEM FOR PROJECTILES
}NOTE: All damage will be ints

}Try to make enemy die (DONE)
}ENEMY BLUE PRINT
NO SPEED: Already on AI Path script
Health, touch damage, particle effects?, animation handler (LATER)
BUG: Enemy touch damage occurs only once

}Player Iframes are in place, just need to add in layers for player to ignore
}NOTE: ENEMY IGNORE ENEMY IN PHYSICS2D LAYER SYSTEM
}Made player sorting layer, layer 3
}https://forum.arongranberg.com/t/seeker-partially-phases-through-wall-while-pathfinding/6032/2
}BUG: Enemy partially goes through wall because A* does not incorporate colliders in math
}MADE ALMOST ENTER GUNGEON HIT DAMAGE, NEED GAMEFEEL AND CAMERA SHAKE

GOAL: MAKE MAP
========
10/28-29/2022
--------
GOAL: Make BOSS AI?
}Not sure if making randomized map is the good idea.  Might be better to focus on making a simple polished game.
}Work on like 5 levels.  Hotline Miami style
}5 Bosses, one is like a flood movement boss like Ori and the Blind Forest but it is reoccuring (blood flood).

Basic Sum of Bosses, more detail below
FIRST BASIC BOSS: Basic Enemy that is super strong who spawn mini version of it.  Bullet hell basically.  The mini version can be reoccuring enemy

BLOOD FLOOD BOSS: First introduced as a boss to make player work on movement skill.  Will comeback again as another mechanic

CLONE BOSS: Make a boss with similar movements and attacks as player (but more animated and not just a hopping blob).
}How to make this boss like mimic the player for the first half

DIMENSION WARPING BOSS THING: How to shift game from top down to a 2d.  Bullet hell, nothing else special, maybe just a boss testing all player skill

FINAL BOSS: Like Furi Final Boss (not the spaceship alien thing) where the player just shoots at the monsters organs 



FIRST BASIC BOSS: Mechanics: Spawn Mini Enemies (maybe only one or two max), shoot lots of bullets like Enter the Gungeon.  Maybe a phase of missile based attacks, final phase of bombs?
				Killing mini enemies will give player like a 30 second window of no enemy


BLOOD FOOD BOSS:

CLONE BOSS: I feel like this boss should be the boss with lazers, swords, axes and other cool weapons in phase 2 and 3 and maybe 4. Needs a cutscene
	
DIMENSION WARPING BOSS: Have more cells.  When changing dimension with the animation, remove all mini enemies and then spawn in mini enemies depending on the phase.  
Maybe add in the Clone Boss but weaker with less damage and less health in the final phase


========
10/28-29/2022
--------
GOAL: Work on BOSS AI and make enemy designs

ENEMY TYPES: Walk and touch player and deal damage (Vampire survivor), enemy stuck on walls that shoot, enemies that move and shoot, enemies that spawn enemies.  
			REUSED ENEMIES: The mini enemy in BOSS 1, BOSS 3 weaker version

TOTAL ENEMIES = 6

}Enemy does not shoot player because the ray cast is hitting its own boxcollider.  How to make it shoot not itself?}
}Make all enemy bullets ignore all enemy related things
}I think the layer, enemyCollides is to let player run through enemies even though they will take damage
}Make a way to make levels easy
}NEED TO MAKE ENEMYSTUCKONWALLRANGE Not walkable
}If Player is Dead, it will no longer move through enemies 
}BUG: Enemy can like walk through the wall due to A* not considering boxcolliders, to deal with this, I will try to make enemy sprite smaller
and make the terrain cannot walk area bigger (Located in A* object in Unity)
Basically, make everything smaller but terrain bigger
}RN, if want to change bullet damage from an entity, cannot change it from entity, have to see the prefab entity has and change it there

}To make swapping thing, player list of weapon, adding gameobject and scroll through player item list

========

GOAL: Make player pick up weapon stuff
Player will have infinite weapon switching.  Basically, I will give player all weapons they can have possibly have like Doom

https://youtu.be/q85gG0GLyG0?t=380 I think this tutorial is my answer to weapon swapping
}Have sprite object on player that can be replaced

BUGS: When swtiching weapon, can swap weapon and each weapon will shoot but the console has this error of courtoine not happening because the game object is not active which is what I want...


========
11/6/2022
--------
GOAL: Make room switching like Binding of Issac or Celeste

new idea to make item allowed, have a bool if weapon is useable, if true than can use it

Currently pick up is picked up via checking tag collision.  Maybe it could be a layer also

GUN PICK UP NOW WORKS

GOAL NOW: MAKE BOSS

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dlEl_G713A Bullet Hell Thing

Change Enemy Structure to have Composition.  Basically, have ranged attacks or not

GOAL: Need to work on boss bullet. Maybe draw. Finish game mechanics before making art
}Player Dash should not be in direction of mouse, direction they are moving
}Adding Has Dash Script
}Dash now works
}BUG: When player is idle, dashing will do nothing because dashing is based on player Vector2 (which is 0 when idle).  Need to make it dash in direction player facing: Handle Direction and rework animation stuff

Peashooter gun like pistol in Doom 2016, there for backup

Add a speed function when shooting bullet in gun Shoot function

When putting player in new scene, it needs to have reference to camera for mouse controller

Maybe in first boss, when spawning in enemy, have it spawn in the corners

When beat boss, take the boss gun and take it stuff

Hitscan gun, make boss that dodge normal bullet so need hitscan

Make bullet spin in circle https://youtu.be/1q7qlmOFRtY?t=2705  Probably for clone second boss

For first boss, make it so that hitting boss the boss could become smaller and then that make it faster making the game hard,  use for narattive story telling thing

} FSM for basic enemies?  Probably not needed just need to flesh out the ai a bit more.
Here is video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VkezxxjsSE

ENEMY TYPES: Walk and touch player and deal damage (Vampire survivor), enemy stuck on walls that shoot, enemies that move and shoot (but keep distance), enemies that spawn enemies (walk randomly?).  
			REUSED ENEMIES: The mini enemy in BOSS 1 (just beefy enemy), BOSS 3 weaker version (reuse)

TOTAL ENEMIES = 6

No need for health composition refacotring since code rn works fine

Goals: Make bullet despawn or is there a wall?, Add more Guns, How to make code reusable, Make enemy designs, HARD: Work on Boss AI, HARD(NEEDED??): Map transitioning and randomization, Map Design?

IMPORTANT NOTE: In Unity I DID THIS:
Go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics2d and Uncheck the box that says "Raycasts Start In Colliders".
This will let you ignore the colliders on the gameobject casting them.

This allows enemy to shoot projectile while ignoring their own collider

}Added A*.  When scanning obstacles with A*, make sure to add colliders on obstacles
}Added bullet script for ranged enemies, could just reuse code for player bullet
}Might need to review courotines more
}FINISHED BASIC AI
}Starting to implement health and damage system
}Added a PlayerBullet layer to ignore collision with player layer
}FINISHED HITTING AND HEALTH SYSTEM FOR PROJECTILES
}NOTE: All damage will be ints

}Try to make enemy die (DONE)
}ENEMY BLUE PRINT
NO SPEED: Already on AI Path script
Health, touch damage, particle effects?, animation handler (LATER)
BUG: Enemy touch damage occurs only once

}Player Iframes are in place, just need to add in layers for player to ignore
}NOTE: ENEMY IGNORE ENEMY IN PHYSICS2D LAYER SYSTEM
}Made player sorting layer, layer 3
}https://forum.arongranberg.com/t/seeker-partially-phases-through-wall-while-pathfinding/6032/2
}BUG: Enemy partially goes through wall because A* does not incorporate colliders in math
}MADE ALMOST ENTER GUNGEON HIT DAMAGE, NEED GAMEFEEL AND CAMERA SHAKE

GOAL: Make BOSS AI?
}Not sure if making randomized map is the good idea.  Might be better to focus on making a simple polished game.
}Work on like 5 levels.  Hotline Miami style
}5 Bosses, one is like a flood movement boss like Ori and the Blind Forest but it is reoccuring (blood flood).

Basic Sum of Bosses, more detail below
FIRST BASIC BOSS: Basic Enemy that is super strong who spawn mini version of it.  Bullet hell basically.  The mini version can be reoccuring enemy

BLOOD FLOOD BOSS: First introduced as a boss to make player work on movement skill.  Will comeback again as another mechanic

CLONE BOSS: Make a boss with similar movements and attacks as player (but more animated and not just a hopping blob).
}How to make this boss like mimic the player for the first half

DIMENSION WARPING BOSS THING: How to shift game from top down to a 2d.  Bullet hell, nothing else special, maybe just a boss testing all player skill

FINAL BOSS: Like Furi Final Boss (not the spaceship alien thing) where the player just shoots at the monsters organs 



FIRST BASIC BOSS: Mechanics: Spawn Mini Enemies (maybe only one or two max), shoot lots of bullets like Enter the Gungeon.  Maybe a phase of missile based attacks, final phase of bombs?
				Killing mini enemies will give player like a 30 second window of no enemy


BLOOD FOOD BOSS:

CLONE BOSS: I feel like this boss should be the boss with lazers, swords, axes and other cool weapons in phase 2 and 3 and maybe 4. Needs a cutscene
	
DIMENSION WARPING BOSS: Have more cells.  When changing dimension with the animation, remove all mini enemies and then spawn in mini enemies depending on the phase.  
Maybe add in the Clone Boss but weaker with less damage and less health in the final phase

10/28-29/2022
--------
GOAL: Work on BOSS AI and make enemy designs

ENEMY TYPES: Walk and die (Vampire survivor), enemy stuck on walls that shoot, enemies that move and shoot, enemies that spawn enemies.  
			REUSED ENEMIES: The mini enemy in BOSS 1, BOSS 3 weaker version

TOTAL ENEMIES = 6

Enemy does not shoot player because the ray cast is hitting its own boxcollider.  How to make it shoot not itself?

Make all enemy bullets ignore all enemy related things

I think the layer, enemyCollides is to let player run through enemies even though they will take damage

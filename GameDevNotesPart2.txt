 Goals: Music, sound effect, Complete the things below

Need to do: 
}The menu options stuff need to use the transition fader thing so it works and everything... 
}Make gun art, enemy art

Stuff: audio, Scene 2 with demo boss: all bosses too: have a door that open only after boss die
	Pick up gun animation thingy, NEED TO DO ART AGAIN...


Game Hierarchy Notes:
My game is not structured with a game manager, instead all of the things typically in a game manager are seperated in different scripts
 - pausing is in a PauseANDGAMEOVEr script located beneath Canvas prefab
 - Scene transitioner is a gameobject that triggers a scene transition AND has a fade in and out effect located in CANVAS
 - There is an Audio Manager as the only manager in the manager prefab object

Make this a sellable product...

Goal: 3 or so hours of gameplay and sell for like 5 bucks.  Super small game
Cool bosses, the original 4 boss idea...

All bosses: Miniboss, First bullet hell boss, flood, the clone

ENEMY TYPES: 
}Walk and touch player and deal damage (Vampire survivor), 
}enemy stuck on walls that shoot, 
}enemies that move and shoot (but keep distance), 
}enemies that spawn enemies (walk randomly?).  			
}REUSED ENEMIES: The mini enemy in BOSS 1 (just beefy enemy), 
}BOSS 3 weaker version (reuse)

My new enemy:
}Chase player like a dog
}Charging player
}EnemyShoot but with a shotgun
}EnemyShoot but rapid fire 

TOTAL ENEMIES = 6

Dungeon based room like Issac of Binding//// I guess like Enter the gungeon...

} When making room, make it using the Krita file with the Leve1Area1 

========

--------
Using TestingLevel krita document to make level

}Made all the enemies on paper.  Total is like 10, 8 different types with one have three different variations...

}Work on game mechanics ideas:
Portal, speed boosters, slow ground, traps
More enemy spawning like doom or enter the gungeon...
}Level Design

Just make particle super cartoony...
Door 
}Made particles...
}Working on blood remnants, maybe just make it homtline miami but the wall thing...

Ignore the blood remain on the ground cause not that important...

}To make spped booster or slowerer, it the same script but I think to make it work, need to make it a generic that get the same variable of movespeed and adjust it

Goal: Make the basic game feel
}Gun feel
}Enemy Death
}Enemy shooting animations: https://youtu.be/2YdTpHlyw1s?t=485 hell is other demons reference
Player will look at the projectile more than the enemy shooting, only for bosses they would look at the player

Make camera fit in area like hollow knight...

}Enemy shooting animation...

Need to make audio manager things...

Starting again, audio manager

========
04/22/2023

Audio mixer manager things
think my audio will be done with prefabs and not with scripts like CodeMonkey

What kind of audio is in games...
music, sfx, dialogue	//I think thats all there is necessary for my game, probably no dialogue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdX7nhH6jdM this my audio manager

Goal: try to implement the most basic shooting and reloading sounds ever and music sounds and make it work with my script TODAY

NOTE: Need to save audio in the saving thing i programmed

The manager is gonna hold all audio and be the source of music and player sound effects, since player always like main part of game
- enemies and other things will have their own audio sources so it just get the music from the manager and plays it from their own audio source

Nvm, just make it all from the main house

I achieved my goal almost

Gotta save it and adjust things from setting somehow

========
04/23/2023
--------
Finished being able to adjust volume, but only in the start screen since the options menu there works but not in first game 
GOALS: Need to do menu stuff thingy in the header notes, idk what that means
Make audio options save with either player prefs or my save system

RN: trying to save volume things with player prefs...
I think I did it

RN: Need to fix game hierarchy, make things work between scenes, what do all scenes ect.

BUG: (Maybe) I don't think bool if want full screen or not is saved any where...

Note: I think I do not need CheckPointManager to be a singleton, it just needs to just have one in every level but it can be different
Why do i even have a checkpoint system...

I don't think my game has a checkpoint system, when fighting boss, will spawn player at boss again (main bosses though)

Fixed up game hierarchy, it is not in one game manager but instead is over several scripts

GOAL: FIx the header note and MAKE A GAME

BUg: hearing no sound because by default, game sets audio to player prefs but currenlty player pref has it = 0

Let try to polish game with one basic enemy and one boss (that mini boss)

Here's what i am thinking:

Art:
Mini Boss, Basic Enemy, Make Gun like 20 minutes until dawn rotation, make enemy death thing (maybe make it the same as door explosion)

Sound:
Mini boss attacks, basic enemy walking, gun sounds, gun pick up sound, gun reload, gun shoot, door explosion, enemy death sounds...

Game mechanics:
Mini Boss attacks
- mini gun, charge attack, run really fast attack
- half hp
--run really fast and shot gun attacks
--spiral attack of death after going into the center

4 attacks in total...

20 minute till dawn reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL8jo7bqRg0

FIXING CAMERA RESOLUTION CHANGING SIZE THING
I googled this: unity changing resolution effects camera size

Need to redesign levels to make it like more room like enter the gungeon

Changing PlayerSIze: 1.454219 to 1.120025

Have to animate player in 8 directions, should be easy though

Today I: Made enemy designs, animated range enemy and working on player

i interned today

========
05/24/2023

Player Animation will only have up, bottom right, bottom left, down (down kinda looks like middle but will check), no top corners

??=   What is this



This is maybe new tutorial on how to handle aspect ratioooo, maybe just focus that on second game then...

Finish Last Run Enemy Animation, it will just have run and idle animation (idle when it attack and just pauses...)

Here is what  i listred before of my boss attacks...

Game mechanics:
Mini Boss attacks
- mini gun, charge attack, run really fast attack
- half hp
--run really fast and shot gun attacks
--spiral attack of death after going into the center

4 attacks in total...

This is revamped gun animation thing
20 minute till dawn reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL8jo7bqRg0

Boss Animations:
Idle (all angles, maybe like 2 frames)
Walk (just walk to player for a bit like enter the gungeon)
run really fast (just another run animation)


Other notes:
mini gun / shotgun just activates when walking... ( eye changes color, same scrippt with gun overheating)
spiral attack (happpens on death) (probably not in final implementation of game)


The eye will have to be an asset in Unity to allow unity to change color instead of animating color change...


Finished up player, maybe add in a dash thing.... 

In my second game, also figure out how art works, like i think player when i add box collider 2d the unity game
knew just to outline my game and not the background


========

I will just make boss just big version of the shooty guy

Okay so new plan:

Need to 'code' AI now and level design, i have all the enemie art done, 
Things to do below:
-Handle enemy death...
-Code Enemy AI
-Level Design
-Level Transition??
-Make boss
0: Health Bar on Top or whatever, manage zooming out with image not being messed up or make it like enter the gungeon

-Music
-Sound effects

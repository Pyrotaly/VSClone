Need to do: 
}The menu options stuff need to use the transition fader thing so it works and everything... 
}Make gun art, enemy art

Stuff: audio, Scene 2 with demo boss: all bosses too: have a door that open only after boss die
	Pick up gun animation thingy, NEED TO DO ART AGAIN...

Make this a sellable product...

Goal: 3 or so hours of gameplay and sell for like 5 bucks.  Super small game
Cool bosses, the original 4 boss idea...

All bosses: Miniboss, First bullet hell boss, flood, the clone

ENEMY TYPES: 
}Walk and touch player and deal damage (Vampire survivor), 
}enemy stuck on walls that shoot, 
}enemies that move and shoot (but keep distance), 
}enemies that spawn enemies (walk randomly?).  			
}REUSED ENEMIES: The mini enemy in BOSS 1 (just beefy enemy), 
}BOSS 3 weaker version (reuse)

My new enemy:
}Chase player like a dog
}Charging player
}EnemyShoot but with a shotgun
}EnemyShoot but rapid fire 

TOTAL ENEMIES = 6

Dungeon based room like Issac of Binding//// I guess like Enter the gungeon...

} When making room, make it using the Krita file with the Leve1Area1

Using TestingLevel krita document to make level

}Made all the enemies on paper.  Total is like 10, 8 different types with one have three different variations...

}Work on game mechanics ideas:
Portal, speed boosters, slow ground, traps
More enemy spawning like doom or enter the gungeon...
}Level Design

Just make particle super cartoony...
Door 
}Made particles...
}Working on blood remnants, maybe just make it homtline miami but the wall thing...

Ignore the blood remain on the ground cause not that important...

}To make spped booster or slowerer, it the same script but I think to make it work, need to make it a generic that get the same variable of movespeed and adjust it

Goal: Make the basic game feel
}Gun feel
}Enemy Death
}Enemy shooting animations: https://youtu.be/2YdTpHlyw1s?t=485 hell is other demons reference
Player will look at the projectile more than the enemy shooting, only for bosses they would look at the player

Make camera fit in area like hollow knight...

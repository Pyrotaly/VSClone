Goal: 3 or so hours of gameplay and sell for like 5 bucks.  Super small game
Cool bosses, the original 4 boss idea...

All bosses: Miniboss, First bullet hell boss, flood, the clone

ENEMY TYPES: 
}Walk and touch player and deal damage (Vampire survivor), 
}enemy stuck on walls that shoot, 
}enemies that move and shoot (but keep distance), 
}enemies that spawn enemies (walk randomly?).  			
}REUSED ENEMIES: The mini enemy in BOSS 1 (just beefy enemy), 
}BOSS 3 weaker version (reuse)

My new enemy:
}Chase player like a dog
}Charging player
}EnemyShoot but with a shotgun
}EnemyShoot but rapid fire 

TOTAL ENEMIES = 6

Dungeon based room like Issac of Binding//// I guess like Enter the gungeon...
